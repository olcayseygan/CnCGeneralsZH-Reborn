# Photograph the same frame of the same match twice, once through Direct3D 9 and once through the
# Direct3D 11 backend, and count the pixels between them.
#
# This is RENDERER-ROADMAP.md phase 2's exit measurement.  Everything else about the backend is a
# count - buffers mirrored, pipelines built, draws made and refused - and a run can have all of
# those right and still draw the wrong picture: the white terrain had a correct atlas, a correct
# program and a correct draw count for two sessions.  Only two pictures of one frame settle it.
#
# All three shots come from one exe.  -d3d9 is the only difference between them, so a view that
# comes back apart is the backend and not a build, a map or a seed.
#
# Three shots, not two.  The instrument has noise of its own: particles advance per rendered frame,
# so each view is photographed twice through Direct3D 9 as well and the pair's own disagreement is
# printed beside the signal.  That floor is 0.0% to 0.8% by count and 0.03 to 0.18 levels by mean.
#
# Two numbers a pair, and the pass rule is the mean.  This changed once the error got small, and the
# reason is in the numbers rather than in anybody's preference.  The count is pixels more than 40
# apart in summed channels: a coverage measure.  A boundary pixel that one rasteriser fills and the
# other does not flips between a leaf and the sky and clears 40 without difficulty, so the count
# tracks how much foliage is in the view - 0.18% on Golden Oasis against 1.44% on Flash Effect while
# the mean over the same eight views moves only from 0.56 to 0.91 levels a channel.  The two
# rasterisers have been shown to agree at every sub-pixel position across a whole pixel, ties
# included (test_pixelcentre), so a boundary pixel can only land differently because the vertex
# reaching it differs in its last bits - which is the transform, and no backend makes two of those
# bit-identical.  Below about 2% the count is measuring content and the mean is measuring error.
#
# So a view passes when the mean is under MeanMargin levels a channel.  -CountRule restores the old
# rule (count no further from Direct3D 9 than Direct3D 9 is from itself, plus Margin) for anyone who
# wants the number this phase was originally written against.  Both are always printed.
#
# The views are tree-check.ps1's, for the same reason it has them: they are the eight positions in
# UI-MAP.md that between them frame terrain, trees, water, roads, shadows and the command bar.

# -Map narrows the run to the views whose map name contains it, for the middle of a hunt where one
# view answers the question and eight of them is twenty-four launches.  The table in
# RENDERER-ROADMAP.md is only ever written from a full run.
#
# -BackendNoise takes the repeated pair through the Direct3D 11 backend instead, which answers a
# different question: the printed floor is Direct3D 9 against itself, and a backend with a
# repeatability of its own would be measured against a floor that cannot see it.
#
# -Extra passes further switches to all three shots, which is how a pass is taken out of both sides
# at once: -Extra -nofx, -Extra -noshadowvolumes, -Extra -noshroud. A difference that collapses when
# one pass is gone belongs to that pass, and one that does not is somewhere else.
#
# -MeanMargin is the pass threshold in levels a channel, and 1.0 is the frame buffer's own step: two
# frames that agree to within the smallest value the buffer can hold are the same frame.
#
# -dx11post is the one switch that must never be added here.  It runs an effect over the finished
# frame on purpose, so a run with it on disagrees with Direct3D 9 by design and this script would be
# measuring the effect rather than the backend.  Its own before and after is a pair of pictures.

# The whole frame, where tree-check.ps1 stops at row 520 to keep the command bar out of a comparison
# about trees.  Carrying that limit over here hid a bug for the length of the phase: the 2D layer was
# drawn half a pixel off under Direct3D 11, 45% of the command bar was past this threshold, and every
# number this script printed was blind to it.  An instrument that cannot see part of the picture
# cannot be the exit condition for drawing the picture.

# boundary pixel that one rasteriser fills and the other does not flips between a leaf and the sky
# and lands well past the threshold, so a frame that is aligned to the pixel and correct in every
# other way still counts a percent of its foliage edges. The mean is a fidelity measure: it is what
# the frame is wrong by, and a mean of a level a channel is the same picture whatever the count says.
