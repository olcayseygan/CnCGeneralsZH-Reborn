// The route as a band of measured width, and the rules a unit uses to decide where across it to
// drive.  Everything here is behind -crowd; without it none of it is built or consulted.
//
// The band is the part retail has no equivalent of.  A route is a line, every unit handed one
// steers at the same metre of it, and a group of twenty crossing open ground therefore drives in
// single file for no reason anybody chose.  A corridor measures how much ground there actually is
// either side of that line, sample by sample, and then a lane is a distance across it - not a
// share of it.  The distinction is not cosmetic: a fraction of the width pulls units into every
// wide bay the route passes and swings them backwards round the outside of corners, which is what
// the first version of this did.
