 * before the next attempt *is* the length of the freeze everybody sees.  Four doublings put that at
 * 1.2 and then 2 seconds after only three and four losses of the same command - which a couple of
 * percent of packet loss produces routinely over a long game with eight players - and there is
 * nothing else in flight to congest with anyway, because a blocked machine has stopped generating
