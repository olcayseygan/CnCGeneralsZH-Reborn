// The moved lock.

// The engine writes its vertices and indices once, into a write-only D3D9 buffer that nothing can
// read back, so the only chance to build the D3D11 copy is while the write is happening.  What has
// to hold is that the D3D9 side ends up byte for byte what it would have been without the twin and
// the D3D11 side ends up holding the same thing.  Both sides are read back here: the D3D9 one is a
// heap block standing in for the mapped pointer, and the D3D11 one comes back through a staging
// buffer, which is the only way to see what UpdateSubresource actually wrote.
